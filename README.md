# Board definitions library

This lirary contains configuration tweaks for different boards supported by Mongoose OS.

## Changes
This repository specifically contains an entry for **NUCLEO-F446RE** board that houses a 
STM32F446RE chip. This would allow you to compile your Mongoose OS apps to STM32F446RE 
microcontroller. Functionality for other microcontroller can be implemented in somewhat the
same way.
